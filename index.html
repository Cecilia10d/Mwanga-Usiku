<h2>About Us</h2>
 <p><strong>Mwanga Usiku</strong>, meaning "A Light in the Night" in Swahili, embodies our vision to uplift
     struggling women and girls. We aim to empower them by teaching practical skills, providing business
    opportunities, and sharing the hope of the One True Light that guides them through their darkest moments.
    Our mission is to encourage healing through creativity, fostering a desire for each individual to recognize
    their God-given potential.</p>

       <p>When girls are not empowered with vocational skills, they often face limited career prospects, leading to
        financial dependency and vulnerability. Studies have shown that un empowered women are at greater risk of
        poverty, domestic violence, and exploitation. By providing access to skill-building opportunities, we can
        help break this cycle of neglect and ensure that women and girls have the means to support themselves and
        their families. Organizations worldwide emphasize the importance of education and skill development in
        reducing gender inequalities and improving overall community health and wealth. Together, we can create a
        brighter future for women and girls, allowing them to thrive and contribute meaningfully to society.
        </p>
        <p>At Mwanga Usiku, we believe in empowering women with skills and providing them with sewing machines, as well
            as teaching girls essential skills like hairdressing, stitching, fashion design, and technical skills. This
            approach is crucial for fostering self-employment opportunities. Empowering women and girls not only equips
            them for the job market but also promotes independence and confidence. By providing access to skill-building
            opportunities, we can help break the cycle of neglect and ensure that women and girls have the means to
            support themselves and their families.
